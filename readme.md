Sublime Text 3 Replacement App Icon
===

An app icon I designed for Sublime Text 3 which preserves the spirit of the original, but is updated for the flat UI guidelines of OS X Yosemite.

## Usage

1. Quit Sublime Text 3.
2. Move the [icns file](/Sublime Text.icns) to the Resources folder inside your copy of ST3 (For most, this should be at `/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/Resources`) You'll have to overwrite the original file, so create a backup of it if you desire.
3. Right-click Sublime Text.app and Get Info.
4. Right-click System Preferences.app and Get Info.
5. Select the icon in the System Preferences info window and then Copy (⌘-C) it. Close that info window.
6. Select the icon in the Sublime Text info window and Paste (⌘-V). It should have pasted the System Preferences icon.
7. Now press delete to remove the System Preferences icon data, and the replacement icon should be visible. Close the Sublime Text info window.
8. Re-open Sublime Text 3 to get back in business, *in style*.
